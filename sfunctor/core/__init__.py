"""Core computational modules for structure function analysis.

This subpackage contains the performance-critical components of SFunctor,
including Numba-accelerated histogram computation, physics calculations,
and parallel processing utilities.

Modules
-------
histograms
    Numba-accelerated histogram building for structure functions
physics
